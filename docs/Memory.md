5. Known Bugs (From Code Reading)

6. Technical Debt

Debt
Effort to Fix
State management
No ViewModel, no StateFlow anywhere
Medium (Phase 1)
Persistence
SharedPreferences in Composables
Medium (Phase 1)
DI
No Hilt, no dependency injection
Medium (Phase 1)
Widget updates
No AlarmManager, no WorkManager
Medium (Phase 2)
Widget content
Style preference read but never applied to widgets
Low
Navigation
String literals, no type safety
Low (Phase 1)
Strings
Hardcoded UI strings throughout

Testing
2 autogenerated placeholder tests
Medium (Phase 9)

com.example.*
Low-effort, immediate fix
R8
Disabled
Trivial fix
7. Architecture Decisions Made
Decision
Choice
Reason
UI framework
Jetpack Compose ✅
Modern, correct
Navigation
Navigation Compose ✅
Already in place
Widget rendering
RemoteViews XML ✅
Required for AppWidget
Font
Space Mono ✅
Nothing OS aesthetic
Clock update mechanism
Currently updatePeriodMillis ❌ → AlarmManager
Android caps min at 30 min
Persistence
SharedPreferences ❌ → DataStore
DataStore is the modern replacement
DI
None ❌ → Hilt
Standard Android DI
State
Local remember ❌ → StateFlow + ViewModel
Lifecycle-safe
Theme
Dark only → add Light + dynamic color
Accessibility, user preference
8. Coding Conventions (as found in repo)
Convention
Current Practice
File organization
ui/screens/
, 
ui/components/
, 
ui/theme/
, 
widgets/
 — clean ✅
Color naming
Named constants in 
Color.kt
 ✅ but inline hex also used
Typography
Typography.labelSmall
 etc. used ✅
Commit messages
Conventional Commits format (
feat:
, 
fix:
) ✅
Shape
androidx.compose.ui.graphics.RectangleShape
 inline — needs extraction
Imports
Wildcard 
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.*
 — acceptable for Compose
9. Current Milestone
Phase 0: Triage
 (Not started — this analysis IS the prerequisite to Phase 0)
Next immediate actions (in order):
Change package ID in 
build.gradle.kts
Fix 
targetSdk
 = 
compileSdk
 = 35
Enable R8 (
isMinifyEnabled = true
, remove 
optimization { enable = false }
)
Add 
BootReceiver.kt
 + register in Manifest
Add AlarmManager scheduling for ClockWidget (set 
updatePeriodMillis = 0
)
Remove dead Terminal nav tab
Fix 
Icons.Default.ArrowBack
 → 
AutoMirrored
10. Next Milestone
Phase 1: Architecture Foundation
Add Hilt
Add DataStore
Create ViewModels for all 3 screens
Migrate CustomizeScreen from SharedPreferences to DataStore-backed ViewModel
Type-safe navigation
11. Important Context for AI Sessions
What the AI MUST know before suggesting any code change:
This is a pure Compose project
 — no XML layouts in the app (only in widget RemoteViews)
No Hilt yet
 — don't assume DI is set up
No DataStore yet
 — don't assume any persistence infrastructure
Widget providers are in 
.widgets
 package
 — 4 classes: ClockWidget, DateWidget, BatteryWidget, WeatherWidget
Bottom sheet in CustomizeScreen uses 
BottomSheetScaffold
 (experimental API, 
@OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3Api::class)
)
SharpToggle is a custom composable
 defined at the bottom of SettingsScreen.kt — not a Material component
WidgetCard takes a content slot
 (
BoxScope.() -> Unit
) — this is the pattern used for all gallery items
The Canvas dot-pattern background
 in CustomizeScreen is in the scaffold's 
content
 slot, not the sheet
AGP version is 9.3.1
 — very new, may have API differences from typical tutorials
Kotlin version is 2.2.10
 — very new, use Kotlin 2.x compatible syntax
Common mistakes to avoid:
Don't suggest 
SharedPreferences.Editor.commit()
 — this project should move to DataStore
Don't add 
@Composable
 to ViewModel methods
Don't suggest 
lifecycleOwner
 patterns — use 
collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
Don't use 
rememberCoroutineScope
 for ViewModel operations — use 
viewModelScope
Don't add 
INTERNET
 permission for clock/date/battery widgets — they must work offline
12. Future Improvements (Parking Lot)
Multiple instances of same widget with independent configs (key by 
appWidgetId
)
Lock screen widgets (Android 13+, API 33)
Music Now Playing widget (MediaSession)
Steps widget (HealthConnect)
Widget preset system (save/load named configs)
Setup export (share home screen layout)
Material You dynamic color (opt-in)
Tablet responsive layout (WindowSizeClass)
App widget preview image generation for Play Store screenshots
CI/CD with GitHub Actions (
.github/workflows/android.yml
)
Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting
In-app review (Google Play In-App Review API)
Localization (app is English only right now)
13. Brutally Honest Scores
Category
Score
Reason
Architecture
2/10
No ViewModel, no Repository, no DI, SharedPreferences in Composables
UI Design
8/10
Genuinely beautiful, faithful to Nothing OS, Space Mono is perfect
UX
4/10
Dead nav tab, no onboarding, "ADD" fails silently, hardcoded data in previews
Performance
3/10
No goAsync, clock updates broken, no Doze handling
Maintainability
3/10
573-line CustomizeScreen, all state local, no tests
Scalability
2/10
Adding a 5th widget means copy-pasting the same patterns everywhere
Play Store Readiness
1/10
com.example package, R8 off, no onboarding, no privacy policy
Code Quality
4/10
Commits are clean, structure is logical, but logic is entirely in UI layer
Security
6/10
No network calls (yet), no sensitive data — clean by omission
Accessibility
2/10
No content descriptions, no TalkBack testing, no light mode
OVERALL
3.5/10
Strong visual foundation, broken as a product
What this project IS:
A beautiful, well-designed UI prototype that demonstrates strong aesthetic sense and Compose fundamentals.
What this project IS NOT:
A working Android widget app ready for production.
The gap:
The gap between "looks good in screenshots" and "works reliably on a stranger's phone" is where all the missing architecture lives. The good news: the hardest part (design decisions and visual execution) is done well. The missing parts (DataStore, AlarmManager, ViewModel) are well-documented patterns with clear implementation paths.
