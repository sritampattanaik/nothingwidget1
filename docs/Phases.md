## Phase 1 — Architecture Foundation (✅ DONE)
**Objective**: Introduce MVVM, DataStore, and Hilt so all future development is clean.

### Post-Phase 1 Major Architectural Migration (Repo 2 Integration) (✅ DONE)
The app has successfully transitioned to the Google AI Studio design (Repo 2 UI). The following changes were implemented and successfully built:
1. **Removed Repo 1 UI Architecture**: Deleted the old UI components, screens, navigation, and theme files.
2. **Integrated Repo 2 Architecture**: Copied over the `data`, `domain`, `ui`, and `widget` layers from Repo 2.
3. **Strict Visual Parity Sync**: Addressed and reversed minor local UI deviations to strictly enforce 100% visual and layout parity with Repo 2 (e.g. `enableEdgeToEdge()` in `MainActivity.kt`, and matched padding rules).
4. **Database Migration**: Replaced the legacy `DataStore` based repository with the new `Room` database implementation (`AppDatabase`, `WidgetConfigDao`, etc.).
5. **Dependency Resolution**: Added `Room`, `Coil`, `Retrofit`, and `Moshi` dependencies. Switched from KSP to KAPT for Room compiler to fix JVM signature conflicts. Resolved metadata version conflicts by updating Room to `2.7.0`.
6. **Cleaned Leftover Artifacts**: Purged old Repo 1 files like `WidgetRepositoryImpl.kt` and `AppModule.kt` that were causing compilation issues.

### Post-Phase 1 Bug Fixes (Automated Codebase Scan)
The following issues were identified and immediately fixed:
1. **Deprecated Logout Icon**: `SettingsScreen.kt` used `Icons.Filled.Logout`. Fixed by removing the entire vestigial `ACCOUNT` section as requested by Phase 3 design goals.
2. **Deprecated API usage**: `Theme.kt` used `window.statusBarColor` which is deprecated in Java. Added `@Suppress("DEPRECATION")` to safely suppress it since edge-to-edge migration isn't necessary yet.
3. **Unresolved TODO**: `HomeScreen.kt` had a `TODO` for the FAB `onClick`. Fixed by pointing it to `Screen.Customize("clock").createRoute()` as a placeholder.
4. **Dead UI Code**: `HomeScreen.kt` contained a dead decorative "FIRMWARE" row. Removed to match Phase 4 design goals.
5. **XML TODO**: Removed an auto-generated Android Studio `TODO` inside `data_extraction_rules.xml`.

### Post-Phase 1 State Persistence Bug Fixes
The following critical state management and persistence bugs were identified and fixed:
1. **Widget Overwrite Bug (Bug 1)**: Fixed an issue in `WidgetRepository.allConfigs` where saving a single customized widget to the Room database would cause all other unedited preset widgets to disappear from the gallery. The repository now correctly merges default presets with saved entities using `associateBy { it.id }`.
2. **Missing Widgets on App Restart (Bug 2)**: Resolved by the same `WidgetRepository` fix. Since the initial database is empty on a fresh install or restart (if no edits were made), the repository now correctly falls back to generating the default preset list instead of returning an empty list.
3. **Step Tracker Flow Bug**: Fixed an issue in `StepTrackerRepository` where calling `incrementSteps()` attempted to synchronously evaluate a Room database `Flow`, resulting in broken step increment logic. Introduced `getStepsForDateSync()` in `StepDao` to correctly read the current step state.
4. **Direct Widget Pinning Fix**: Updated the pinning logic in `WidgetGalleryScreen.kt` (`requestPinWidget`) to pass the explicit `Class<*>` via `Class.forName()` to `ComponentName`, fixing a bug where Android's native pinning flow was failing to trigger or bypassing the direct pin overlay.

### Definition of Done
App compiles with Hilt, no SharedPreferences anywhere
Each screen observes ViewModel StateFlow
Navigation uses typed routes
No business logic inside any Composable
## Phase 2 — Widget Engine (✅ DONE)
Objective: Make widgets actually work reliably — correct data, correct update timing, survive reboot. 
Est. time: 3–5 days
Tasks
2.1 Clock Widget — true per-minute updates
ClockUpdateReceiver.kt
 — BroadcastReceiver triggered by AlarmManager
ClockUpdater.kt
 — schedules 
setExactAndAllowWhileIdle
 at next minute boundary
ClockWidget.onUpdate()
 — reads config from DataStore via coroutine, builds RemoteViews with correct time string AND color
2.2 Date Widget — midnight updates
DateUpdateReceiver.kt
 — fires at midnight, reschedules for next midnight
DateWidget.onUpdate()
 — formats date per user's chosen format, sets text
2.3 Battery Widget — polish existing
Extract duplicated battery-reading logic into 
BatteryRepository
Add 
ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED
 / 
DISCONNECTED
 handling for charging indicator
Remove 
savedStyle
 variable that's read but never used
2.4 Boot Receiver
BootReceiver.kt
 — on 
BOOT_COMPLETED
:
ClockUpdater.schedule(context)
DateUpdater.schedule(context)
Enqueue WeatherWorker if weather widget is placed
2.5 Widget Info XML updates
All 4 widgets: add 
targetCellWidth
, 
targetCellHeight
, 
previewLayout
, 
description
Clock/Date: 
updatePeriodMillis="0"
Battery: 
updatePeriodMillis="0"
 (event-driven)
Weather: 
updatePeriodMillis="0"
 (WorkManager-driven)
2.6 goAsync() in all onUpdate() methods
Wrap DataStore reads in 
goAsync()
 + coroutine scope
Definition of Done
Clock widget shows correct time within 1 second of opening home screen
Clock widget updates at :00 of every minute (verified by watching for 3 minutes)
After 
adb shell reboot
, all widgets are present and showing correct data within 60s
Battery widget shows correct % matching Android status bar
## Phase 3 — Settings Persistence (✅ DONE)
Objective: Make the Settings screen actually save and apply settings. 
Est. time: 1–2 days
Tasks
SettingsViewModel reads/writes AppPreferencesDataStore
"WIDGET REFRESH RATE" selection actually persists and is read by WorkManager interval
"DOT-MATRIX INTENSITY" slider persists and affects the Canvas in CustomizeScreen
"THEME" selection persists (dark only for now, extended in Phase 5)
"LOG OUT" — remove (there's no account system; this is vestigial UI)
"SYNC DATA" — remove or implement as "Force refresh all widgets"
Settings screen no longer shows "ONLINE" / "DEVICE STATUS" hardcoded hero — replace with real device/app info (version name, widget count, etc.)
Definition of Done
Killing and relaunching the app shows the same Settings values
Refresh rate change reflects in actual WorkManager periodic interval
## Phase 4 — Home Screen Polish (✅ DONE)
Objective: Make the Home/Gallery screen show real live data previews, not hardcoded values. 
Est. time: 2 days
Tasks
Clock card preview: already uses `LaunchedEffect + delay(500)` ✅ — keep this
Date card preview: hardcoded "MON 28 JULY" -> replace with `LocalDate.now()` formatted
Battery card preview: hardcoded "87%" -> replace with real battery level via `BatteryRepository`
Weather card preview: hardcoded "CLEAR SKY" -> show placeholder "-- °" until data available
FAB ("+" button): implement — navigate to a widget picker or show a bottom sheet for choosing which widget to add
"FIRMWARE_V2.0.4 / DOWNLOAD" row at bottom — remove (decorative, confusing to users)
Definition of Done
Every widget card on Home screen shows live data
No hardcoded date/percentage visible to user
FAB does something useful
Phase 5 — Customization Persistence & Apply
Objective: Make the Customize screen actually save settings and apply them to real widgets. 
Est. time: 2–3 days
Tasks
CustomizeViewModel.loadConfig(widgetType)
 reads from DataStore on screen entry
All option selectors (size, style, color, font, background) update ViewModel state
Live preview reacts to ViewModel state changes (already visually OK — just needs to read from VM)
"ADD" button → 
viewModel.applyToWidget()
:
Saves to DataStore
Calls 
AppWidgetManager.updateAppWidget()
 with new RemoteViews built from saved config
If 
requestPinAppWidget
 succeeds → toast "Widget added to home screen"
If 
requestPinAppWidget
 not supported → show a dialog: "Long-press your home screen → Widgets → NothingWidget → [widget name]"
Settings per widget must be keyed by 
appWidgetId
 (Int), not just 
widgetType
 (String) — allows multiple instances with different configs
Definition of Done
Change color to red, tap ADD → widget on home screen shows red text within 3 seconds
Place same widget type twice → each instance can have different colors independently
Kill app, reopen Customize → previous selections are pre-filled
Phase 6 — Onboarding
Objective: New users understand how to use the app in < 30 seconds. 
Est. time: 1 day
Tasks
OnboardingScreen.kt
 — shown on first launch only (tracked via DataStore boolean)
3 steps: (1) See your widgets → (2) Customize them → (3) Add to home screen
Step 3 shows illustrated instruction: long-press home → Widgets → NothingWidget
"GET STARTED" button marks onboarding complete and navigates to Home
Definition of Done
First launch shows onboarding
Subsequent launches skip onboarding
User can re-trigger onboarding from Settings → "How to add widgets"
Phase 7 — Weather Widget (Real Data)
Objective: WeatherWidget shows actual weather using OpenMeteo (no API key required). 
Est. time: 3 days
Tasks
Add Retrofit + Kotlin Serialization to dependencies
OpenMeteoApi.kt
 — Retrofit interface for current weather endpoint
WeatherRepository.kt
 — fetches, caches last known weather to DataStore
WeatherWorker.kt
 — WorkManager PeriodicWorkRequest (15 min interval minimum)
Request 
ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
 permission in app for location
Show "Grant Location" prompt in WeatherWidget customize screen if not granted
WeatherWidget shows real temperature + WMO weather code → icon mapping
Graceful offline state: show last known weather with timestamp
Definition of Done
Weather widget shows real temperature within 2 minutes of placement on fresh install
Widget shows cached data when offline, with "last updated X min ago" label
Unit toggle (°C/°F) immediately applies to displayed temperature
Phase 8 — Design Polish & Accessibility
Objective: Every pixel is intentional. Every element is accessible. 
Est. time: 2–3 days
Tasks
Move all inline 
Color(0xFF1A1A1A)
 references to theme/Color.kt named constants
Extract all 9+ 
RectangleShape
 references to a named 
SharpShape
 constant
Add 
contentDescription

All touch targets ≥ 48dp
Phase 9 — Testing
Objective: Build confidence for Play Store release. 
Est. time: 3–4 days
Tasks
Replace 
ExampleUnitTest.kt
 with real unit tests:
CustomizeViewModelTest
 — color change updates state
WidgetRepositoryImplTest
 — save and retrieve config
DateFormatterTest
 — each format option produces correct output
BatteryCalculationTest
 — level/scale → percentage edge cases
Add instrumented tests:
HomeScreenTest
 — all 4 widget cards visible
CustomizeScreenTest
 — bottom sheet opens, size selection updates preview
NavigationTest
 — back navigation works correctly
Manual device testing matrix:
Pixel 6 (Android 13)
Samsung Galaxy (One UI — different launcher)
Any device with MIUI/Xiaomi (aggressive battery management)
Android 8.0 (minSdk = 26 compliance check)
Definition of Done
