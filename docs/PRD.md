NothingWidget — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Version 1.0 | Based on actual codebase analysis of 
sritampattanaik/nothingwidget1
 | Status: Draft → Production
1. Vision
NothingWidget is the definitive home screen widget app for Android users who want the Nothing OS aesthetic — dot-matrix typography, sharp geometry, red accent language — on 
any
 Android device. Built in Jetpack Compose, it brings beautiful, battery-efficient, deeply customizable widgets beyond Nothing hardware boundaries.
One-line pitch:
 
"Your home screen, reinvented. Nothing-style. Any phone."
2. Problem Statement
What exists today
The current codebase (
nothingwidget1
) is a proof-of-concept app with:
A visually strong Compose-based gallery and customization UI (Space Mono font, black/red palette, sharp geometry)
4 widget providers: Clock, Date, Battery, Weather — all registered in the Manifest
A bottom sheet customization system with Size / Style / Color / Font / Background selectors
A live preview in the Customize screen
What is broken or missing (discovered by code analysis)
Widget providers are hollow.
 ClockWidget, DateWidget, WeatherWidget only set text color from SharedPreferences — they do 
not
 set actual time/date text. 
ClockWidget
 never calls 
setTextViewText
 for time; it relies entirely on 
TextClock
 in XML (which auto-updates itself but can't receive RemoteViews-set fonts/colors reliably on all launchers).
No persistence architecture.
 
SharedPreferences
 is used directly in Compose composables via 
LocalContext
, violating MVVM. There is zero ViewModel, zero Repository, zero DataStore.
Clock widget updates every 60,000ms
 via 
updatePeriodMillis
 — the Android minimum is actually 1,800,000ms (30 min). The 60s value is silently capped by the OS; the widget will NOT update every minute via this mechanism.
No WorkManager or AlarmManager
 for widget refresh — no BOOT_COMPLETED receiver — widgets die after reboot.
Weather widget shows hardcoded "24°"
 — no real data, no API, no placeholder even.
Date widget shows hardcoded "MON 28 JULY"
 in HomeScreen preview — not live.
optimization { enable = false }
 in release build — R8/ProGuard disabled, APK will be enormous and unobfuscated.
Package ID is 
com.example.nothingwidget
 — an example namespace, not publishable to Play Store.
No onboarding
 — user has no guidance on how to add widgets to home screen.
Bottom nav has a "Terminal" tab
 (Code icon) that navigates nowhere — dead UI.
"ADD" button in CustomizeScreen
 calls 
requestPinAppWidget
 which only works on supported launchers (Pixel/stock); on Samsung it silently fails with no feedback.
FIRMWARE_V2.0.4 / PRECISION_QUARTZ_ENGINE / LON: -0.1273 | LAT: 51.6974
 are decorative hardcoded strings — left over as UI chrome, not real data.
No accessibility
 — no content descriptions on any icon or widget.
No dark/light mode toggle
 — theme is hardcoded dark only, no 
lightColorScheme
.
targetSdk = 34
 while 
compileSdk = 37
 — inconsistent, targetSdk should match compileSdk.
Theme.Material.Light.NoActionBar
 in themes.xml — a Light theme for a dark app, inconsistent with the dark Compose theme.
3. Target Users
Primary — "The Aesthetic Android User"
Age 18–30, premium mid-range to flagship device (Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus)
Curates their home screen obsessively (r/androidthemes, YouTube setups)
Knows Nothing OS exists and loves the design even without owning a Nothing Phone
Secondary — "The Nothing Phone Fan on Other Hardware"
Owns a Pixel/Samsung, uses Nothing earbuds, follows Nothing's brand
Wants visual consistency with Nothing's ecosystem
Tertiary — "The Minimalist Productivity User"
Wants clean, distraction-free widgets — hates bloated widget apps with ads
Values reliability above all — tired of widgets that stop updating

8. User Stories
As a user, I want the clock widget to show the correct time and update every minute,
so that I don't have to open the app to check the time.
As a user, I want my customizations to be saved even after I reboot my phone,
so that I don't have to reconfigure widgets after every restart.
As a first-time user, I want the app to show me how to add a widget to my home screen,
so that I don't get confused when I open the app.
As a user, I want to preview exactly what my widget will look like before placing it,
so that I know what I'm getting without trial and error.
As a developer/power user, I want the app to work fully offline,
so that core widget functionality never depends on internet connectivity.
9. Functional Requirements
FR-01: Widget Update Mechanism
Clock must use 
AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle
 for per-minute updates (not 
updatePeriodMillis
)
Battery must use 
BroadcastReceiver
 for 
ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED
 (✅ partially done, but duplicated logic)
Date must reschedule at midnight via AlarmManager
All widgets must register a 
BOOT_COMPLETED
 receiver to reschedule after reboot
updatePeriodMillis
 must be set to 
0
 for clock/date (they use their own scheduling)
FR-02: Data Persistence
All widget settings must use DataStore Preferences (replace 
SharedPreferences
)
Settings must survive app process death and device reboot
Each widget type gets its own DataStore key namespace
FR-03: Widget Content
ClockWidget must call 
setTextViewText
 with formatted time string (don't rely solely on 
TextClock
 for customized colors — or handle it properly)
DateWidget must call 
setTextViewText
 with formatted date string
BatteryWidget must show actual battery % — ✅ mostly done
WeatherWidget must show real data or show a clear "no location/permission" state
FR-04: App Architecture
Every screen must have a ViewModel
No business logic inside Composables
Navigation routes must be type-safe (use sealed class or 
@Serializable
)
No raw 
Context.getSharedPreferences
 inside Composables
FR-05: Play Store Compliance
Package ID must not be 
com.example.*
R8 must be enabled in release builds
No debug code in production
Privacy policy URL must be provided
targetSdk
 must equal 
compileSdk
10. Non-Functional Requirements
Category
Requirement
Performance
Widget update < 100ms; App cold start < 1.5s
Battery
No continuous background services; AlarmManager only for clock
Reliability
Widgets survive 72h Doze; survive reboot
Compatibility
minSdk 26 (✅ already set); targetSdk = compileSdk
Accessibility
Content descriptions on all interactive elements and widgets
Security
No 
com.example
 package; R8 enabled; no hardcoded API keys
APK Size
< 8MB (currently no bloat, should stay lean)
11. Acceptance Criteria
AC-01: Clock Widget (currently FAILING)
Shows current time on placement
Updates every 60 seconds on-screen
Survives device reboot
Color customization reflects in actual widget
12h/24h format toggle works
AC-02: Date Widget (currently FAILING — no live date in widget)
Shows today's date on placement
Updates at midnight
Date format from customization applies
AC-03: Battery Widget (currently PARTIALLY PASSING)
Shows correct battery %
Updates on charge state change
Color customization reflects in widget
AC-04: Customization Persistence
Settings persist after app kill 
(currently uses SharedPreferences — fragile)
Settings persist after device reboot 
(currently FAILING)
"ADD" button gives feedback on unsupported launchers
AC-05: App Quality

Package ID is not 
com.example.*
R8 enabled in release
